A synergistic irrigation map for China was created for 2005 and 2015 using the software R. The synergistic 
irrigation maps combine different global and regional irrigation products to create one consistent map 
that harmonizes all available information at a spatial resolution of 1 km. After collecting the available 
input data, the scripts displayed in the repository were run. In short, the input products were aligned in their resolution, 
coordinate system and scale, and were reclassified into binary irrigation maps. Second, the aligned maps 
were stacked. After, a scoring table was created which results in priority ranking of each product per 
pixel. Subsequently, the irrigation mean per pixel was calculated. The result was then calibrated and validated 
with national statistics.

The input data frame and final products are available on request corresponding the author.
